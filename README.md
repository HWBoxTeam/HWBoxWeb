A web/mobile cross-platform application which is meant to be used by students to organize their homeworks. The user can add his/her courses to the app, and enter homeworks for each of them. Thus, user can view his/her tasks quickly according to the due date, course name, or completion status. After completing a task, user can remove it from the app or mark as “done” to keep it in the app. Also a reminder will pop-up in the dashboard after opening the app if a homework has to be completed in a little time. The data is stored in the Parse.com database for making it available to all platforms.
